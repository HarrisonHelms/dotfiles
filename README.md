Bashy Config for Mac, Linux, Windows
====================================

Pilfer to your heart's content, at your own risk. 

Note that this stuff has been highly customized for me personally, including
hardcoding some of my usernames. Unless you are me, you should really not run
`setup.sh` (if you do you are simply a moron and I pity you). Instead, create
your own (no, don't just fork this one).

Bash, Node, Go
--------------

These are the [only languages] anyone really needs.

No Python
---------

There I said it.

Python reminds me of my ex-wife. We had good times, but mostly I'm still
angry about all the time and money I invested on her. Read my rants on
[robs.io](https://robs.io).

I have banished Python from my personal workflows and dependencies. Hence,
this new dotfiles repo.

Ya know, Perl was ALWAYS better at this system stuff and is guaranteed 
to be pretty much every Linux/UNIX system made within the last 20 years,
Python isn't. Bubye.

A Note on File Extensions
-------------------------

Although I am normally rather bothered by file extensions for commands (as
all UNIX purists are) I gave in and used `.sh` extensions to keep VSCode
happy on all platforms and figured it conveyed more meaning given the
shortening of names and what not.
