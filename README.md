Bashy Config for Mac, Linux, Windows
====================================

Pilfer to your heart's content, at your own risk. 

Note that this stuff has been highly customized for me personally, including
hardcoding some of my usernames. Unless you are me, you should really not run
`setup.sh` (if you do you are simply a moron and I pity you). Instead, create
your own (no, don't just fork this one).

Bash, Node, Go
--------------

These are the [only languages] anyone really needs.

Python Sucks
------------

There I said it.

Python reminds me of my ex-wife. We had good times, but mostly I'm just
pissed I invested so much time and money into her. Read my rants on
[robs.io](https://robs.io).

I have banished Python from my personal workflows and dependencies. Hence,
the new dotfiles repo.

A Note on File Extensions
-------------------------

Although I am normally rather bothered by file extensions for commands (as
all UNIX purists are) I gave in and used `.sh` extensions to keep VSCode
happy on all platforms and figured it conveyed more meaning given the
shortening of names and what not.
