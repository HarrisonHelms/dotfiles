Bashy Config for Mac, Linux, Windows
====================================

Pilfer to your heart's content, at your own risk. 

Note that this stuff has been highly customized for me personally, including
hardcoding some of my usernames. In other words, unless you are me, do not
run `setup.sh` and if you do, well, you are objectively a moron who does
not read READMEs and deserves what you get.

Bash, Node, Go, and (sometimes) Perl
------------------------------------

These are the [only languages] anyone really needs.

No Python
---------

There I said it.

Python reminds me of my ex-wife. We had good times, but mostly I'm still
angry about all the time and money I invested on her. Read my rants on
[robs.io](https://robs.io).

I have banished Python from my personal workflows and dependencies. Hence, this new dotfiles repo.

Long Live Perl!
---------------

There is a reason `perlre.so` is included in every other interpreted language
the planet. Perl *defined* the standard for regular expressions and still
does. 

Some uninformed morons will write things like "have a healthy disdain for
Perl" in their job descriptions. This just shows how much someone with
Perl shell skills will have the advantage over them.

Consider that the `perl` executable is on every Linux/UNIX computer built for
the last 20 years! Among other things, this is why `perl` is the number one
pick by professional hackers today (even though they don't blast it from the
housetops, and no it isn't Python or Ruby, like on Mr. Robot, even though
Metasploit decided to use Ruby instead of Perl, having started with Perl, but
being caught up in the Ruby craze that never materialized into the ubiquity
Perl still enjoys).

Perl is the most powerful language interpreter found on *any*
Linux/UNIX system ***by default***. Python will ***NEVER*** be able to claim
that. Ruby will ***NEVER*** be able to claim that. In fact, Python AND Ruby
*depend* on the `perlre` lib to even exist. 

Most who accuse Perl of being old and ugly code usually have no idea what
`sed` and `awk` even are and why Larry created `perl` primarily to replace
them. 

Meanwhile, these accolytes champion a brain-dead language that did not see
how short-sighted making white-space significant really was (tanking any
expansion of the language to include multi-line `lambdas` for example.)

Go ahead, have a look at my dotfile and functions and tell me you could
replace the `perl` with `python` or `sed` or `awk` as elegantly. You just
can't.

"But Python has better object oriented programming?"

"So."

It has been wonderful seeing the entire world wake up from its
object-oriented mania. Sure it has its appeal and need, but you simple do
not need it for most interpreted programmingâ€”especially now that Go
dominates the space for complex systems applications so completely.

So perl-bashing script kiddy, run along and play with your toys. Perhaps its
your nap time. And GET OFF MY PERL LAWN! I have no more time to
waste on you.

A Note on File Extensions
-------------------------

Although I am normally rather bothered by file extensions for commands (as
all UNIX purists are) I gave in and used `.sh` extensions to keep VSCode
happy on all platforms and figured it conveyed more meaning given the
shortening of names and what not.
